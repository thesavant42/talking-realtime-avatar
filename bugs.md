# Open Bugs


### Frontend Bugs
 - 1.  Shader Breaks Animation
- When a shader is enabled the model is forced into an "A-Pose", mouth animations, eye animations, all morphgroups are nullified when shader is enabled.
Expected Result: Character should still animate, even if shaders are enabled.

### Questions:

- Open Question: Have we enabled CUDA for Three.js? That may help.
